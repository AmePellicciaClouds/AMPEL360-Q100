# KNU-28-10-001-REQ-001 — LH₂ Storage Subsystem Requirements (Circular Cryogenic / C2)

## 1. Purpose
Define **subsystem-level** requirements for the **LH₂ Storage Subsystem (ATA 28-10)** enabling:
- **minimal boil-off losses**
- **extended ground hold time**
- **stable pressure/temperature control**
- **closed-loop boil-off gas (BOG) recovery** compatible with circular cryogenic principles ("C2").

This document refines and allocates storage-specific requirements from:
- **KNU-28-00-001-REQ-001** (ATA 28 Fuel System — system-level constraints)

---

## 2. Scope
Applies to the LH₂ storage assembly including:
- cryogenic tank(s)
- insulation system (passive + thermal interception provisions)
- BOG capture/recovery provisions (buffering, reconditioning, re-use or re-liquefaction)
- pressure management and vent protection
- sensors and health monitoring (thermal/pressure/leak)
- ground interfaces specific to storage (loading/holding/depressurization)

**Out of scope** (handled elsewhere):
- fuel distribution (ATA 28-20)
- propulsion feed metering (ATA 73/79 interface)
- aircraft-level vent routing/fire zoning (ATA 26/49/51 coordinated requirements)
- electrical generation and aircraft power architecture (ATA 24)

---

## 3. Definitions (Subsystem-Relevant)
- **BOG (Boil-Off Gas):** vapor generated by heat ingress into stored LH₂.
- **Circular Cryogenic (C2):** architecture minimizing vent losses via heat reduction + vapor recovery.
- **Ground Hold Time:** duration storage remains within operational limits without refueling/top-up or unsafe venting.
- **Heat Leak (Q̇):** net thermal power entering the cryogenic boundary.
- **Thermal Intercept Stage:** intermediate-temperature point capturing conduction load before reaching the cold core.

---

## 4. Requirement Parameter Registry (TBD Variables)

| **TST** | Test evidence | 2 *(procedure + report/data log)* |
| **DEM** | Demonstration evidence | 2 *(demo procedure + demo log)* |
| **INS** | Inspection evidence | 1 *(inspection package: checklist + record)* |
| **ICD** | Interface Control Document / interface declaration | 1 *(ICD or interface spec)* |

## 7. Traceability Hooks (Parent Allocation)
This KNU allocates and refines system-level constraints from **KNU-28-00-001-REQ-001**, including:
- system boil-off budget allocation → storage subsystem
- hold-time requirement decomposition → storage + recovery capability
- pressure limits → storage pressure control and protection requirements

**RTM linkage required:**  
KNU-28-00-001-REQ-001 → KNU-28-10-001-REQ-001 *(allocation + rationale)*

---

## 8. Open TBD List (Controlled)
- [TBD] Set P-28-10-QDOT-MAX based on thermal budget allocation and insulation architecture
- [TBD] Set P-28-10-BOG-MAX based on economics + mission readiness + ground constraints
- [TBD] Define P-28-10-HOLD-TGT and ambient envelope (hot-day/cold-soak)
- [TBD] Define P-28-10-P-MIN / P-28-10-P-MAX / P-28-10-P-RELIEF from design + safety
- [TBD] Define recovery topology selection (buffer-only vs re-liquefaction vs reuse path)

---

## 9. Notes (Design Rationale Summary)
Circular cryogenic performance is achieved by:
1) **Passive thermal resistance** (vacuum/MLI or equivalent)
2) **Thermal interception provisions** for conduction paths (supports/penetrations)
3) **Closed-loop BOG recovery** (capture + conditioning + reuse or re-liquefaction)

These measures reduce heat-driven boil-off and avoid routine venting, enabling extended ground hold.
