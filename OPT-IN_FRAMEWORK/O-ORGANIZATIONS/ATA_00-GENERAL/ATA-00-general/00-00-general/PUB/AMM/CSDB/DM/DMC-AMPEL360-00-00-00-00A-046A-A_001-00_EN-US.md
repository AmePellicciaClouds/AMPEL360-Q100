## Unit Conversion Reference Overview

This Data Module provides comprehensive unit conversion tables and precision 
                    rules for the AMPEL360 Q100 program. It ensures consistent unit usage across 
                    technical documentation, with emphasis on hydrogen-specific measurements and 
                    SI/Imperial conversions commonly required in aerospace applications.

Purpose: To provide quick reference 
                    for unit conversions, eliminate conversion errors, and standardize precision 
                    and rounding practices.

Primary Unit System: SI (International 
                    System of Units) is the primary unit system. Imperial/US customary units are 
                    provided as secondary reference where industry practice requires.

## H₂-Specific Units and Conversions

The following specialized units are used for hydrogen systems on the Q100:


### Energy Density



| Quantity | Value (Mass Basis) | Value (Volume Basis) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LH₂ Energy Density | 120 MJ/kg (33.3 kWh/kg) | 8.5 MJ/L (2.36 kWh/L) |
| GH₂ Energy Density (700 bar) | 120 MJ/kg (33.3 kWh/kg) | 5.6 MJ/L (1.56 kWh/L) |
| Jet-A Energy Density (Reference) | 43 MJ/kg (11.9 kWh/kg) | 34 MJ/L (9.4 kWh/L) |



### Boil-Off Rate

Boil-off rate is expressed as percentage of total tank capacity lost per 
                        day (%/day):

Boil-off Rate (%/day) = (Mass Loss per Day / Initial Mass) × 100

Example:
Initial LH₂ mass: 1000 kg
Mass loss after 24h: 3 kg
Boil-off rate = (3 / 1000) × 100 = 0.3%/day

Q100 Design Target: ≤ 0.5%/day 
                        with zero-boil-off (ZBO) cryocooler active.


### Flow Rates



| From | To | Conversion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kg/s | kg/h | Multiply by 3600 |
| kg/h | kg/s | Divide by 3600 |
| L/min (LH₂) | kg/h (LH₂) | Multiply by 4.251 (at 20K) |


Q100 Fuel Cell Consumption: 
                        Maximum consumption rate at full power (2.5 MW per stack): ~0.047 kg/s 
                        or ~170 kg/h of hydrogen.


## Precision and Rounding Rules

Use the following rounding rules based on measurement type and magnitude:



| Quantity Type | Magnitude Range | Rounding Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Length | < 1 m | 1 decimal place (mm precision) |
| Length | ≥ 1 m | 2 decimal places (cm precision) |
| Mass | < 100 kg | 1 decimal place |
| Mass | ≥ 100 kg | 0 decimal places (whole kg) |
| Temperature (Cryogenic) | < 100 K | 2 decimal places |
| Temperature (Ambient) | 100-500 K | 1 decimal place |
| Pressure | < 10 bar | 2 decimal places |
| Pressure | ≥ 10 bar | 0 decimal places (whole bar) |
| Energy Density | All ranges | 1 decimal place |
| Flow Rate | All ranges | 3 decimal places for kg/s, 1 for kg/h |


Significant Figures: Maintain 
                    appropriate significant figures through calculations. Final results should 
                    not exceed precision of least precise input.


## Example Calculations

The following examples demonstrate proper unit conversion and precision for 
                    typical Q100 operations:


### Example 1: Fuel Load Calculation

Problem: Calculate LH₂ fuel load 
                        in pounds given 450 kg of hydrogen.

Given: 450 kg LH₂
Conversion factor: 1 kg = 2.20462 lb

Calculation:
450 kg × 2.20462 lb/kg = 992.079 lb

Rounded per precision rule (≥100 lb → 0 decimal places):
Answer: 992 lb


### Example 2: Cryogenic Temperature Conversion

Problem: Convert LH₂ tank 
                        temperature from 20.5 K to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Given: 20.5 K

To Celsius:
°C = K - 273.15
°C = 20.5 - 273.15 = -252.65°C

To Fahrenheit:
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
°F = (-252.65 × 1.8) + 32 = -422.77°F

Rounded per precision rule (cryogenic → 2 decimal places):
Answer: -252.65°C or -422.77°F


### Example 3: Energy Calculation

Problem: Calculate total energy 
                        content of 450 kg LH₂ in MJ and kWh.

Given: 450 kg LH₂
Energy density: 120 MJ/kg

Energy in MJ:
E = 450 kg × 120 MJ/kg = 54,000 MJ

Energy in kWh:
E = 54,000 MJ × 0.277778 kWh/MJ = 15,000 kWh

Answer: 54,000 MJ or 15,000 kWh


## Usage Notes

Mandatory Use: All technical 
                    publications must use conversions and precision rules defined in this 
                    reference. Deviations require approval from STK_SE.

Calculator Recommendation: For 
                    complex conversions, use the AMPEL360 Unit Converter web application 
                    (tools.ampel360.aero/units) which implements these standards automatically.

Updates: This reference is maintained 
                    by STK_SE. Check for latest version before critical calculations.
