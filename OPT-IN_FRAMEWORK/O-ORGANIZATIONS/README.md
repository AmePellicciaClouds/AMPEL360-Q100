```

## Purpose

The O-ORGANIZATIONS axis provides:

- **Governance frameworks** for aircraft maintenance and operations
- **Regulatory compliance** documentation and airworthiness limitations
- **Maintenance policies** and scheduled check requirements
- **Organizational procedures** for operations and support
- **General information** applicable across all aircraft systems

## Content Pattern

Each ATA chapter follows the canonical SSOT + PUB pattern:

### SSOT (Single Source of Truth)
Engineering artifacts organized by lifecycle phase (LC01–LC14):
- Problem statements and requirements
- Safety and reliability analysis
- Design definitions and configurations
- Verification and validation evidence
- Production, operations, and maintenance documentation
- Training and end-of-life planning

### PUB (Publications)
Controlled deliverables following S1000D standards:
- **CSDB** (Common Source Database): DM, PM, DML, BREX, ICN, APPLICABILITY
- **EXPORT**: Rendered outputs (PDF, HTML)
- **IETP**: Interactive Electronic Technical Publications runtime

## Standards Compliance

- **ATA iSpec 2200**: Chapter and subject structure
- **S1000D**: Technical publication format and CSDB organization
- **EASA CS-25 / FAA Part 25**: Airworthiness requirements
- **ISO 9001**: Quality management system principles

## Navigation

Start with individual ATA chapter folders for specific topics:
- [ATA 00 - General](./ATA_00-GENERAL/)
- [ATA 01 - Maintenance Policy](./ATA_01-MAINTENANCE_POLICY/)
- [ATA 02 - Operations Organization](./ATA_02-OPERATIONS_ORG/)
- [ATA 03 - Support Information](./ATA_03-SUPPORT_INFORMATION/)
- [ATA 04 - Airworthiness Limitations](./ATA_04-AIRWORTHINESS_LIMITATIONS/)
- [ATA 05 - Time Limits & Maintenance Checks](./ATA_05-TIME_LIMITS_MAINT_CHECKS/)
